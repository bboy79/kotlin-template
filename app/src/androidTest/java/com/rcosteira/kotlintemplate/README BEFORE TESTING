To avoid flakiness, Google recommends that you turn off system animations on the virtual or physical device(s) used for testing.
On your device, under Settings->Developer options disable the following 3 settings:
Window animation scale
Transition animation scale
Animator duration scale

If you need to activate Developer options:

Go to settings -> about. Then, click on the build number until dev ops are unlocked!
